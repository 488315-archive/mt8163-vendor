The share library "lib3a.so" is the platform-specific 3A algorithm implementation.
This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.

WHAT IT DOES?
==================
lb3a.so: MTK 3A algorithm including AE (Auto Exposure) algorithm, AF (Auto Focus) algorithm,
AWB (Auto White Balance) algorithm, and strobe AE/AWB algorithm

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libcutils.so
2.  liblog.so
3.  libstlport.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
3A algorithms have dedicated algorithm manager for algorithm control and state machine for 3A flow control,
please refer to the files in 'vendor/mediatek/proprietary/platform/mt6582/hardware/mtkcam/core/featureio/pipe/aaa' folder.
Public 3A HAL interface is defined in aaa_hal_base.h in 'vendor/mediatek/proprietary/hardware/include/mtkcam/hal' folder.

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
