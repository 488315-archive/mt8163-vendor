This module creates program binary service for HWUI rendering enhancement.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
Program binary service is used in conjunction with HWUI for UI rendering.
It enhances rendering performance.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:

libhwui libEGL libGLESv2 libcutils libutils libbinder liblog libui libgui libutils

and the following libs from MediaTek:

libmtk_drvb.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Program binary service is triggered on init stage during bootup. It will
communicate with HWUI automatically for UI rendering.
