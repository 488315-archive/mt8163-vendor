This directory contains the multi_init binary, which is the first process instead of init in meta mode and factory mode.
Multi_init source code will reuse init folder, we just modify the Android.mk and init.cpp file to support meta mode and factory mode.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
For multi_init, we will parse meta_init.rc in meta mode and parse factory_init.rc in factory mode.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1. libfs_mgr
2. liblogwrap
3. libcutils
4. liblog
5. libc
6. libselinux
7. libmincrypt
8. libext4_utils_static
9. libsquashfs_utils
10.libbase
11.libutils
12.libc++_static
13.libdl
14.libsparse_static
15.libz
16.libinit


This module is released in source code format in 'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\system\core\multi_init' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Since in meta mode and factory mode, lk will send the command line"rdinit=sbin/multi_init". So in meta mode and factory mode, it will start multi_init instead of init.
