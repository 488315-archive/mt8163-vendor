MFNR Core


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

An platform-indepent MFNR core to do MFNR logic/algorthim control flow.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1. libutils.so
2. libcutils.so

And it needs mfllmodules.a to build mfllcore library.

The shared lib should be defined by MFLL_SHARED_LIBS.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

All modules (e.g. Camera HAL or an unit test) should use
IMfllCore as the public interface to talk with MFNR core.

All the source code of this program were written by MediaTek co..
