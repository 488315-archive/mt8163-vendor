BluetoothLe is a background process which provides service for GATT-base profiles

BluetoothLe is used by BLEManager by default, but customers can replace BLEManager with customized UI & behavior


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
BluetoothLe include the following profiles:
 - ANP 1.0  (Role: Server)
 - PASP 1.0 (Role: Server)
 - PXP 1.0  (Role: Monitor)
 - TIP 1.0  (Role: Server)
 - FMP 1.0  (Role: Locator / Target)

These profiles are sutable for interaction with Bluetooth Smart wearable devices

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
1. BluetoothLe functionality is exposed by Mediatek framework APIs. 

Path to framework APIs:
/vendor/mediatek/proprietary/frameworks/base/bluetooth/java/com/mediatek/bluetooth/
/vendor/mediatek/proprietary/frameworks/base/bluetooth/java/com/mediatek/bluetoothle/

Developers can develop their own App based on these APIs

2. Mediatek also provides a default UI implementation which interact with BluetoothLe to allow users to interact with wearable devices via BLE link

Path to BLEManager: 
/vendor/mediatek/proprietary/packages/apps/BLEManager/

It's suggested that developers reference the App to learn the usage of the Mediatek APIs for BluetoothLe
