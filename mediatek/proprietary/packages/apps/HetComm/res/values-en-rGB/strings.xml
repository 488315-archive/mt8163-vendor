    </h1><br>Download large files at top speed by using Wi-Fi and 4G/3G at the same time.\
    <h4>1. Go to Settings and tap Turbo Download.</h4>\
    <h4>2. Tap the switch to turn on Turbo Download.</h4>\
    <p><b>[Tip]</b> To increase speed when connected to both Wi-Fi and 4G/3G when starting to download.\
    <p><b>[Tip]</b> If a Wi-Fi or 4G/3G connection is too slow use this faster network connection for downloading.\
    <p><b>[Tip]</b> The network environment may affect the speed and performance of Turbo Download.\
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- An unstable signal will affect the speed and performance of this feature.\
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- however, on average, the download speed will be twice that of Wi-Fi or 4G/3G when used alone.\
    <p><b>[Tip]</b> Should the difference in speed between Wi-Fi and 4G/3G become large (normal is 2.5 times), Turbo Download will stop to avoid degrade of speed.\
    <p><b>[Tip]</b> Turbo Download will be disabled automatically if Tethering/Vpn is turned on.\
