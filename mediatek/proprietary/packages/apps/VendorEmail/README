Email Provider List is a new feature for user to add/setup an email account conveniently. 
It supplies a list of mail providers to the user, makes the process 
of setup an email account more specific and direct, and of course UI looks friendlier, 
offers better user experience.

When one item on the list is chosen, user will be leaded to AccountSetupBasics to fill 
in account information, such as email address and password, however, there are some 
important points here: 
If one particular mail provider is chosen, such as 163/gmail etc, AccountSetupBasics 
will give user a specific hint on email address and when user taps an ¡°@¡± right after 
a valid email account, the email address will be completed with the given mail 
provider¡¯s domain, and focus jumps to password view.
 
If user chooses a general mail provider item (ie. Exchange/others), it just works as before.
If correct email address and password were given, it should setup an account successfully 
by just tapping next, everything goes well and being transparent to user.



WHAT IT DOES?
=============
To make this feature more modular and handier for customers to do customization, we just 
divide it into two parts: Email host part and VendorEmail plug-in part. As provider list 
feature is more related with the provider configuration and UI, main logic is kept in Email 
host part, and customers can just ignore it , what¡¯s important to customers is the mail 
providers¡¯ configuration and how the configuration changes UI and account setup flow, so 
configuration information is kept in VendorEmail part, a series of xml files are used to 
implement this. Install both Email.apk and VendorEmail.apk if you want 
to enable Email Provider List Feature, uninstall VendorEmail.apk if not, and Email works as 
well as before. And all the configurations are placed in VendorEmail.apk, in which customer 
can do customization freely.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
