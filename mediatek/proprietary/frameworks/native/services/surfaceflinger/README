WHAT IT DOES?
=============
This folder is used to store DRM default image resource.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
DRM default image is a binary file, no need to build it.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

When secure video playback is enabled, only HW modules can access the
secure video buffer (i.e. cannot handle by GLES).

Therefore, DRM default image will be shown as a hint if GLES path is used by mistake.

All the images in this folder were created by MediaTek co..
