This module creates the MAGE (MediaTek Android Graphics Environment) A3M 3D
graphics engine java native interface libraries.
This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
A3M is the native graphics engine which is used in conjunction with the ngin3D
Java framework.  These two components form the MAGE middleware used for 2D/3D
graphics applications.

libja3m.so contains the native side JNI interface for the A3M engine.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It's binary release.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
The A3M libraries should not be used directly by an application developer.  The
ngin3D framework provides a more suitable API

The majority of source code for this library were written by MediaTek.  Various
open source libraries are also used and contained in this folder.
