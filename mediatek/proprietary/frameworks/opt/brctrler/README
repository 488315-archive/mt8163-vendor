Library of MTK WFD features, controlling output bitrate.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libbrctrler.so can help control the output bitrate of WFD.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libstagefright_foundation

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
It monitors the output bitrate, and then tell users if need to restrict bitrate.
Converter uses it to check if we need lower or higher output bitrate.
