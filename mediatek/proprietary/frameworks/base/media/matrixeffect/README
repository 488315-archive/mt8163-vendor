HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
Build command:mmm vendor/mediatek/proprietary/frameworks/base/media/matrixeffect


HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Firstly, using getInstance() method ot create an object. Then, using 
initialize() method to set the size and format of preview frame buffer 
which is going to be processed later to native, and set effect 
numbers to native, using setBuffers() to set buffers pointer to native
and using setSurface() to set surface to native.  

Above is a preparation, then, using process() to process frame buffer 
repeatly, call release() to stop processing and release all the resource 
when wanting to stop
