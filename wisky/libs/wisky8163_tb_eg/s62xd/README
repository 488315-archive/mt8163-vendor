This module creates S62XD, the calibration daemon for the S62X magnetic field
sensors from Smartsensor Inc.

This daemon is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
S62XD is the native daemon which is used in conjunction with the Android Sensor
framework. It reads the magnetic field measurement from S62X device driver and
write back the calibrated result. So that, Android Sensor HAL can read the
calibrated magnetic field measurement from S62X device driver.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
> ./mk $(PROJECT_NAME) mm

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
The S62XD should be invoked by init.rc or equivalent mechanisms. It only
interacts with S62X device driver and writes data for housekeeping at
/data/misc/s62x folder.
