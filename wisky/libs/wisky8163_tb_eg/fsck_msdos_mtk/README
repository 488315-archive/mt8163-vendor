WHAT IT DOES?
=============
With Low Cost Android + large size FAT (usb/sdcard/...), we may have limit memory to run the original fsck_msdos on them.
The MTK fsck_msdos_mtk design a new approach to largely reduce the memory foot print but with the increase of the checking time.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
Turn on the feature at corresponding ProjectConfig.mk as following and rebuild.
MTK_FSCK_MSDOS_MTK=yes 


HOW TO USE IT?
==============
After the rebuild, VOLD will use fsck_msdos_mtk to check FAT partition automatically
