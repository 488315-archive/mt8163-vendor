This is used for Mali 3D GPU driver implementation.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
The core 3D driver implementation used to process EGL/GLES commands submmited from
framework or 3D games.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libutils
2.  libcutils
3.  libbinder
4.  libc
5.  libdl
6.  libui
7.  libhardware
8.  liblog
9.  libstlport
10. libsync

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmtk_mali_user.a
2.  libgralloc_extra.so
3.  libgpu_aux.so
4.  libdpframework.so

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Android framework EGL/GL wrapper will load the 3D user space driver through egl.cfg.
EGL/GLES related APIs will pass to the wrapper and go through this user space driver.
This module is responsible for preparing HW jobs to GPU.
